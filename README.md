## Features

- **Ship Placement**: Players can place their ships on the board at the start of the game. Ships can be rotated and positioned according to player preference.
- **Gameplay**: The game follows the traditional Battleship rules where two players (you and the computer) take turns guessing the location of the opponent's ships on a grid.
- **Winning Condition**: The game ends when all the ships of either player are sunk. The game displays a message indicating whether the player or the computer won.
